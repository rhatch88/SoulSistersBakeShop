Soul Sisters Bake Shop

Soul Sisters Bake Shop is a project I developed to showcase a bakery website. The goal was to create a user-friendly, fully responsive, visually appealing website. This project demonstrates my skills in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration.

My features list changed a bit from what I initally submitted so heres a revised features list: 

1. Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.

2. Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved): Users are currently unable to enter an invalid email. 

3. Create a form and store the submitted values using an external API (e.g. a contact form, survey, etc): The contact form submissions are handled using the Pantry service, which stores the data securely. I submitted the pantry key in the Capstone Project Turn-In Google form. To see the basket please visit https://getpantry.cloud/. You'll need to click Dashboard in the upper right corner and enter the pantry key. You'll then need to select SoulSistersBakeShopForm on the left.

4. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app: The website also includes a Google Maps feature to help users easily find the bakeryâ€™s location. The map is interactive and places a pin a location, providing clear directions.


Instructions for Running the Project:
Clone the Repository. Add the .env file found in my capstone submission form. You can either right click on index.html and open with live server or install node.js, npm run start, and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the website.


Thank you for taking the time to look at my project.
